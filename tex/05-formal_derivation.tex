\section{Formal Derivation of Saturated Responses}
  \label{sec:formal_derivation}

  This section adds the minimal mathematical structure required to connect the relational
  framework to effective physical response.
  It provides an explicit effective action for the projected relaxation degree of freedom and
  shows how mass-like, charge-like, and inertial responses arise under finite projective
  capacity.
  The goal is not to postulate new fundamental fields, but to identify the minimal effective
  structures necessarily induced by bounded relational update flux.

  \paragraph{Scope of Section 5.}
    This section provides a formal effective derivation of mass-like, charge-like, and inertial
    responses from bounded projective capacity.
    The objective is to establish existence and internal consistency rather than microscopic
    uniqueness.
    Completeness with respect to the full Standard Model gauge structure is not claimed and is
    deferred to higher-rank oriented saturation analyses.
    Throughout this section, the term ``derivation'' is used in this effective sense, with all
    closure assumptions stated explicitly.

\subsection{Relational flux and projective capacity}
\label{subsec:relational_flux}

We represent the local relational update content by a rank-two tensor density
\begin{equation}
  J_{\mu\nu} \equiv \partial_{\mu}\phi \, \partial_{\nu}\phi,
  \label{eq:relational_tensor}
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ encodes the effective relaxation mode surviving projection.
The projection $\Pi$ is assumed to have finite capacity.
Operationally, this means that the observable description cannot resolve arbitrarily large
values of relational flux invariants constructed from $J_{\mu\nu}$.
We parametrize this limitation by introducing a saturation scale $b$ with dimensions of a
flux density.

The minimal Lorentz-invariant completion enforcing boundedness while recovering the standard
quadratic kinetic term at low flux is the Dirac--Born--Infeld-type Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BI}}(\phi)
  \equiv b^2\left(1-\sqrt{1-\frac{\partial_{\mu}\phi \,
  \partial^{\mu}\phi}{b^2}}\right).
  \label{eq:lagrangian_dbi_scalar}
\end{equation}
Equivalently, the associated action reads
\begin{equation}
  S_{\Pi}[\phi]
  = -b^2 \int d^4x
  \left(
    \sqrt{-\det\left(
                 \eta_{\mu\nu}-b^{-2}\partial_{\mu}\phi \,
                 \partial_{\nu}\phi
    \right)} - 1
  \right),
  \label{eq:action_bi}
\end{equation}
making explicit that saturation corresponds to an effective deformation of the metric
volume element as relational flux approaches $b$.

For weak gradients, $\partial\phi \ll b$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:lagrangian_dbi_scalar} expands as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BI}}(\phi)
  = \frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}\phi \, \partial^{\mu}\phi
  + \frac{1}{8b^2}
  \left(\partial_{\mu}\phi \, \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2
  + \mathcal{O}\!\left(b^{-4}\right),
  \label{eq:dbi_expansion}
\end{equation}
recovering the linear-response regime.

\subsection{Isotropic saturation and the emergence of a mass scale}
\label{subsec:isotropic_mass}

Isotropic saturation corresponds to saturation reached through the scalar invariant
\begin{equation}
  X \equiv \partial_{\mu}\phi \, \partial^{\mu}\phi,
  \label{eq:kinetic_invariant}
\end{equation}
rather than through direction-dependent components.

Equation~\eqref{eq:lagrangian_dbi_scalar} enforces boundedness but does not generate a mass
gap.
A gap arises when isotropic saturation selects a typical finite-flux background.
In a projection-limited regime, $X$ aggregates many unresolved relational configurations.
Under a fixed capacity bound, coarse-graining produces concentration of measure around a
typical saturation value $X_{\star}$.

We encode this statistical rigidity through the effective completion
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{iso}}
  \equiv \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BI}}(\phi)
  - \frac{\kappa}{2}\left(X-X_{\star}\right)^2,
  \label{eq:iso_completion}
\end{equation}
where $X_{\star}$ denotes the saturation-typical value.
We stress that the quadratic form is not claimed to be uniquely derived.
The existence of a typical value follows from concentration arguments, but the detailed
functional form of the penalty reflects a minimal local and analytic closure.
Alternative closures are not excluded.
The role of Eq.~\eqref{eq:iso_completion} is to demonstrate the existence of a mass gap
under isotropic saturation, not to provide a microscopic derivation of the penalty.

Let $\phi=\phi_0+\delta\phi$ with $X[\phi_0]=X_{\star}$.
Expanding to second order yields
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\delta\phi}
  \simeq
  \frac{1}{2}Z(X_{\star},b)\,
  \partial_{\mu}\delta\phi\,\partial^{\mu}\delta\phi
  - \frac{1}{2}\kappa\,(\delta\phi)^2,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  Z(X_{\star},b)
  \equiv \left(1-\frac{X_{\star}}{b^2}\right)^{-3/2}.
\end{equation}
The equation of motion takes the Klein--Gordon form
\begin{equation}
  \left(\Box + m_{\mathrm{eff}}^2\right)\delta\phi = 0,
  \label{eq:kg_effective}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  m_{\mathrm{eff}}^2 = \frac{\kappa}{Z(X_{\star},b)}.
  \label{eq:meff_general}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Inertia as the linear limit of saturated update rates}
\label{subsec:inertia_update}

To relate bounded DBI kinetics to inertial response, we consider a particle-like reduction.
Specifically, we focus on homogeneous or slowly varying modes for which the dominant effect
of saturation is captured by a single collective coordinate $x(t)$.
This reduction is valid when spatial gradients are subdominant and the observable probes
global reconfiguration rates rather than local field structure.

For such a mode, the DBI kinetic sector induces the generalized momentum
\begin{equation}
  p = \frac{m_{\mathrm{eff}}\,\dot{x}}{\sqrt{1-\dot{x}^2/a_{\star}^2}},
\end{equation}
where $a_{\star}$ denotes the maximal admissible update rate.
Defining $\mathcal{F}\equiv dp/dt$, the equation of motion becomes
\begin{equation}
  \ddot{x}
  = \frac{\mathcal{F}}{m_{\mathrm{eff}}}
  \left[
    1+\left(\frac{\mathcal{F}}{m_{\mathrm{eff}}a_{\star}}\right)^2
  \right]^{-1/2}.
  \label{eq:dynamical_derivation}
\end{equation}
This equation follows from the Legendre transform of the DBI kinetic term and exhibits a
linear regime together with asymptotic saturation.

The phenomenological form
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^2 \mathcal{O}}{dt^2}
  = a_{\star}\,
  \mathcal{S}\!\left(
                 \frac{\mathcal{F}}{m_{\mathrm{eff}} a_{\star}}
  \right),
  \label{eq:saturated_fma}
\end{equation}
with $\mathcal{S}(x)=\tanh(x)$, represents a smooth analytic closure of the same universality
class.
Inertia thus emerges as the linear-response limit of bounded update dynamics.

\subsection{Oriented saturation and the emergence of a local $U(1)$ symmetry}
\label{subsec:oriented_u1}

If at least two relational degrees of freedom remain unresolved, the saturation-preserving
manifold is a compact connected one-dimensional space, uniquely $S^1$.
A minimal realization is
\begin{equation}
  \psi \equiv \rho\,e^{i\theta},
  \label{eq:complex_mode}
\end{equation}
with $\rho$ fixed near $\rho_{\star}$ and $\theta$ underdetermined.
The redundancy
\begin{equation}
  \theta(x)\rightarrow\theta(x)+\alpha(x)
  \label{eq:local_phase}
\end{equation}
requires a compensating connection.
Introducing
\begin{equation}
  D_{\mu}\psi \equiv (\partial_{\mu}-iqA_{\mu})\psi,
  \label{eq:covariant_derivative}
\end{equation}
yields
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ori}}
  = b^2\left(
         1-\sqrt{1-\frac{D_{\mu}\psi\,D^{\mu}\psi^{\ast}}{b^2}}
  \right)
  - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}.
  \label{eq:oriented_lagrangian}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Immediate falsifiability}
\label{subsec:falsifiability_bound}

The effective action~\eqref{eq:action_bi} ceases to define a real description when
\begin{equation}
  \partial_{\mu}\phi\,\partial^{\mu}\phi > b^2.
  \label{eq:bound_violation}
\end{equation}
The framework is ruled out if strictly linear behavior is experimentally required beyond
this scale.

Universality of $b$ provides a second falsifiability channel.
Identifying the saturation threshold with the Schwinger field
$E_{\mathrm{S}}\sim b/e$ yields the benchmark
\begin{equation}
  b \sim 10^{24}\,\mathrm{J\,m^{-3}},
\end{equation}
up to order-unity factors.
Failure of cross-sector consistency between inertial, mass, and strong-field phenomena
would falsify the bounded-response hypothesis.
