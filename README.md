This repository contains the source of paper _Charge, Mass, and Inertia as Saturated Responses in a Pre-Geometric
Relational Description_ (Cosmochrony paper E)

This work develops a **structural and effective interpretative framework** in which mass, electric charge,
and inertial response are understood as effective descriptors arising from saturation of response
under non-injective projection.

The analysis does not introduce new dynamical laws, fields, or particles.
Instead, it provides a unified conceptual interpretation of existing physical quantities, fully
compatible with Standard Model phenomenology.

## Core Thesis

The framework developed in this work is based on the following central statements:

1. **Mass, charge, and inertia are not independent primitives**  
   These quantities need not be introduced as fundamentally distinct properties.
   They can be understood as different symmetry realizations of a single structural mechanism.

2. **Effective responses are subject to intrinsic saturation**  
   Physical descriptions arise through projection from an underlying relational configuration.
   When relational variations exceed the resolving capacity of this projection, effective responses
   become bounded.

3. **Symmetry distinguishes minimal physical properties**
     - isotropic saturated response corresponds to mass
    - oriented saturated response corresponds to electric charge
    - finite-resolution response under acceleration corresponds to inertia
    These symmetry classes establish existence and internal consistency rather than completeness.

4. **Standard Model dynamics remains unchanged**  
   The framework does not modify gauge structure, particle content, or dynamical equations.
   All established phenomenology is recovered in the linear, unsaturated regime.

## Relational and Projective Description

At the conceptual level:

- physical observables arise from an **underlying relational description**
- no spacetime manifold, metric, or field content is assumed as fundamental
- observable quantities label **equivalence classes** of underlying configurations
- the projection to effective observables is generally **non-injective**

This non-injectivity implies an intrinsic loss of descriptive resolution.
Saturation arises when additional relational variation can no longer be resolved within the
effective description.

The framework treats saturation as a **limitation of description**, not as a modification of
microscopic dynamics.

## Saturation and Symmetry Classes

A key result of the analysis is a classification of effective physical properties in terms of
symmetry of saturated response:

- **Isotropic saturation**  
  Uniform inhibition of effective response in all directions.
  Interpreted as mass, accounting naturally for inertial and gravitational behavior.

- **Oriented saturation**  
  Directionally biased response, allowing attractive and repulsive interactions.
  Interpreted as electric charge, with sign corresponding to orientation.

- **Finite-resolution response**  
  Resistance to rapid reconfiguration under acceleration.
  Interpreted as inertia, arising from limited descriptive resolution.

These properties are not introduced as separate entities.
They emerge as complementary limits of the same bounded-response mechanism.

## Consistency with Standard Model Phenomenology

The framework is fully consistent with established physics:

- the Higgs mechanism remains responsible for mass generation
- gauge symmetry and charge conservation are preserved
- Lorentz invariance is recovered in unsaturated regimes
- no deviations are predicted in experimentally tested domains

The work addresses the **conceptual origin** of physical quantities, not their numerical values.

## Scope and Limitations

This work is:

- **interpretative rather than dynamical**
- **conceptual rather than predictive**
- **agnostic** about the microscopic realization of the relational description
- adopts minimal effective closures where microscopic derivations are not specified

It does **not**:

- derive Standard Model parameters
- predict new particles or interactions
- propose experimentally accessible deviations at particle-physics scales

It **does**:

- provide a unified conceptual account of mass, charge, and inertia
- clarify their mutual relations and symmetry structure
- identify saturation as a common structural origin
